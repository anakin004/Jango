Regarding glfw init - I want to end up seperating that from window creation
                    - currently I just want to get stuff appearing 

-- to add, look at returning raw ptr from create-factory function (dangerous)
-- let user know its raw ptr, properly take over ownership to destroy
-- probably make unique ptr
-- as long as user doesnt missue unique ptr, window destruction garunteed

-- work on adding layer classes for layers and overlays (in progress)
-- implimenting modern opengl with glad 		(not started yet)
-- imgui for debugging 					(not started yet)		




-- ideas
-- multiplayer for people to collaborate on same game
   : using valve api possibly
