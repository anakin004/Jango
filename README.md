
# Jango Engine 

## What's Being Worked On
- **Full 3D Renderer** 
- **2D Renderer**
- **Physics Libraries Integration**:
  - [Box2D](https://box2d.org/)
  - [PhysX](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX)
- **Multiplayer Networking Support** (planned after)

> **Note:**  
> Some files may still reference the old engine name (**Crimson**). This will be updated as development continues.
