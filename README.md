# Jango Engine 

# IMPORTANT: I decided to work in a development repository apart from this. There is going to be doing a big release of Jango in the upcomming weeks! It will be including a full 3D renderer, 3D renderer will likely come first and then the 2D renderer, libraries like Box2D, Physx, yaml-cpp, assimp, and some networking multiplayer stuff soon after! If you are seeing this watch my repository! I am very excited for this upcomming release! I changed the game engine's name to Jango, was previously Crimson, so that is why in the files you will see Crimson, not Jango

Jango is an open-source game engine currently under development including 2D and 3D environments
imported tools used are found in the Crimson/vendor directory
